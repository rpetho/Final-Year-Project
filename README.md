# Final-Year-Project
My final year project I based my disertation on.
I spent over 1 year working on this, I was attempting to teach machine learning AI on how to play a simple turned based combat game against a player. While I am proud of this work I do believe a lot more could of been done, as I had originally intended for the machine learning AI to be trained under 3 different scenarios, against "Dummy" AI were it follows simple commands, with those commands changing in each scenario to create a new version of the AI that would react differently to the player. This didn't come to pass, and what I finalised with is a simple singular AI fighting 1 dummy AI. With a playable mode also added in later in development. Everything is made within this from the ground up, besides the framework that created and provided by unity.
